Hello there, thanks for checking my personal page!

I’m Juan Manuel Luna, a multilingual Electronics Engineer turned Software Developer.
I’m passionate about optimizing and transforming processes with technology. 

Check out [the software platforms I use](/swdev), my [public portfolio](/projects), or
grab my contact info from the footer section.

Inquiries about my work, freelance, or potential opportunities are certainly welcome. I’m usually never far from a computer and can reply in reasonable time. Thank you!
