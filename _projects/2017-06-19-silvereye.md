  IMU powered wireless motion capture
tech: C++, Arduino, Qt, Ogre3D, MakeHuman
---
Silvereye is an IMU based motion capture system for the lower limbs. The system
captures and transmits kinematic data wirelessly from seven sensors. These
measurements are then processed to perform gait analysis and animate a 3D avatar
in "real time".

This system was developed as my Bachelors Thesis. Its code is open source
and can be assambled with cheap components. You can
