Comunic-ARTE is an aesthetic education project in Cali, Colombia, that stimulates
expressive practices (drawing, dancing, drama, music and media) in schools in
low-income communities. Through arts and media children are encouraged to
discover their talents, to enhance their emotional, intellectual and aesthetic
abilities, and to learn about their civil, cultural and media rights and how to exercise 
them.

For this project a custom and responsive WordPress theme was developed, 
based off [Underscores](https://underscores.me/).
