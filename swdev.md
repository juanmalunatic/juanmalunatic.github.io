I face challenges and solve complex technical issues with creativity, discipline, good programming practices, and a mindset of perpetual learning.

To this date, I use the stack below:

### Back-end

I have experience with back-end service creation using PHP (Laravel), Node.js
and Java SE. I'm used to working with SQL databases, Linux environments, cloud 
service providers (Google Cloud) and web scraping.

<i class="devicon-java-plain-wordmark colored"></i>

### Front-end

I have ample front-end experience in the fundamental web stack (HTML, CSS3, JavaScript) and in developing responsive layouts.

## But that tech is kind of outdated!

I started developing for the web back in 2007 (the old Internet Explorer days)
and then Eng school happened as the web kept growing without me 🤷‍.

However, I like to think I have strong fundamentals and I'm catching up fast.
Stay tuned for adventures with the latest SPA JavaScripts and flavor-of-the-month
ML libraries 💪.
